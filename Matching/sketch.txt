Project Idea: Matching Tutor Applicants to Enrolled Tutees
    Inputs:
        - Tutor Applications
        - Tutee Enrollment Information
        - Session logistics
    Output:
        - Tutor and Tutee objects with relevant attributes
        - Matches: A list of lists of tuples, (tutee, tutor), per session
            - Algorithm should place significant weight on trying to get
            sessions as evenly sized as possible
        - Priority Queues: for each tutee, a priority queue of tutors, matched
        and unmatched (with unmatched getting higher priority by some scalar),
        to potentially replace the tutor for a given tutee (in case someone
        rejects the match or drops out)
        - Some analytics:
            - most in-demand subject: max{demand}
            - most in-supply subject: max{supply}
            - 'unicorn' subjects: min{(supply/demand)}
            - overrepresented subject: max{(supply/demand)}
            - Most popular day(s) (by how much)
            - Most popular time(s) (include informational/opinion questions)
            - Most popular format (by how much) (and why?)
        - Session coordinator email lists and templates
