Project Idea: Matching Tutor Applicants to Enrolled Tutees
    Inputs:
        - Tutor Applications
        - Tutee Enrollment Information
        - Session logistics
    Output:
        - (lists of) Tutor and Tutee objects with relevant attributes
        - Matches: A list of lists of tuples, (tutee, tutor), per session
            - Algorithm should place significant weight on trying to get
            sessions as evenly sized as possible
        - Priority Queues: for each tutee, a priority queue of tutors, matched
        and unmatched (with unmatched getting higher priority by some scalar),
        to potentially replace the tutor for a given tutee (in case someone
        rejects the match or drops out)
        - Some analytics:
            - most in-demand subject: max{demand}
            - most in-supply subject: max{supply}
            - 'unicorn' subjects: min{(supply/demand)}
            - overrepresented subject: max{(supply/demand)}
            - Most popular day(s) (by how much)
            - Most popular time(s) (include informational/opinion questions)
            - Most popular format (by how much) (and why?)
        - Session coordinator email lists and templates

Project sketch
- produce tutor/tutee objects with attributes from Inputs
- write a function taking in a two lists, of tutee and tutor objects, and
returning paired tuples, PQs by tutee index
- second function taking tutee/tutor pairings list and session coordinator/
org logistics information and outputting email lists, email templates, etc.

Data cleaning
- will need to clean up the input data: shouldn't ask every tutor to put down
'0' for subjects unwilling to tutor, so maybe we fill in blanks with 0 so the
numerical comparison works
- the form itself needs to have specific times (i.e. "Wednesday, 
4:30-6:00pm CT") for tutor convenience and clarity, but our internal comparisons
will be simplified by changing every instance of the specific to a simple code,
i.e. "WED". Same idea for subject names.
- This is not a major issue - whatever we'd like to input can be run through a
simple wrapper to make these changes

Weights:

    Day/time, availability, is the highest weighted element in matching.

    Secondarily we're concerned with an alignment on subject matter, especially
    for the rare student with a unique subject requirement, i.e. Mandarin,
    Physics, Biology, etc.

    Here we should check if the tutee has requested a returning tutor. With some
    simple string parsing, we can check through the list of all tutor applicant
    names.

    Third we're going to try to make sure tutors are with tutees of an age/
    grade-level they are comfortable working with.

    Fifth, if there are still multiple options for tutors at this point in
    filtration, we should look at experience, attitude, and perhaps seniority.
    Previous experience with PT may be weighed more highly.
